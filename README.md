# honk
A python command line tool that rings Bolt scooters

### How it works ###
The tool communicates directly with bolt.eu's API's so that it tells it to ring a scooter of your choice. It is required that you generate an authentication token beforehand that is associated with a phone number otherwise the API will reject the request.
